# net-arch-tutorial
A tutorial for network theory in archaeology based on using python. This is a document I am working on; as such it is neither finished nor satisfactory. Feedback welcome, and I'll try to update this as I go along with new resources etc.

## Goals
By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:

1. load existing spreadsheets into python
2. apply basic operations to them
3. create adjacency matrices or dictionaries
4. display basic networks
5. calculate simple statistics
6. be aware of other resources and future directions to investigate
