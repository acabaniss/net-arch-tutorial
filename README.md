# net-arch-tutorial
A tutorial for network theory in archaeology based on using python. This is a document I am working on; as such it is neither finished nor satisfactory. Feedback welcome, and I'll try to update this as I go along with new resources etc.

## Goals
By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:

1. load existing spreadsheets into python
2. apply basic operations to them
3. create adjacency matrices or dictionaries
4. display basic networks
5. calculate simple statistics
6. be aware of other resources and future directions to investigate

## How to use Github for a tutorial
Within each of the folders above you should find 1) a .md file, which will load as a webpage on the GitHub website, and 2) python scripts with example code. For each section you'll want to read through the .md file, possibly following some of the links for suggestions on resources and professionally developed tutorials.

## How to get Python and NetworkX installed
I strongly recommend [Enthought Canopy](https://store.enthought.com/licenses/academic/) for Python, which has a free academic license and will give you a package manager that is easy to use. 

Once you install Canopy, open it up and click on the package manager; a quick search for the NetworkX package should pop up a result and you can install it there and then. (You may also have a lot of updates the first time you open the software; that's normal, and it's probably best to let those go ahead and run.)
