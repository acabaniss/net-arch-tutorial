# Introduction to Python

Python is a programming language designed to be powerful and flexible, but also with a low cost of learning the basics. This might also be described as being "easily Google-able" in that once you know the basic way that functions and data structures work, you can look up what else you need to know on a case by case basis.

## Real tutorials for the basics

There are several good resources out there for learning the basics of python.

*  If you are looking for something more along the lines of a course, Codecademy has a free python course, found [here](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python). 

* If you are looking for something more like a walkthrough, there is an official Python Tutorial that takes you through many of the basic functions and data types, found [here](https://docs.python.org/2.7/tutorial/).

* "How to the Think Like a Computer Scientist" has a version for Python 2 that introduces basic computer and coding concepts for non-specialists, found [here](http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english2e/ch01.html).

* Python also offers a list of guides for Programming for Non-Programmers, which can be found [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers).

* The Programming Historian has many tutorials, but the  one on text files and python offers an introduction to some basic python features, found [here](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/working-with-text-files).
